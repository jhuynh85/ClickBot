ClickBot 
by Joseph Huynh

DESCRIPTION:
============
Bot for the Clickfast Flash game (http://www.andkon.com/arcade/mousegames/clickfast/).

HOW IT WORKS:
============
The bot continuously captures an image of the current screen and searches the image
for a pixel whose color matches a known RGB value.  If a match is found, it moves the 
mouse pointer to the corresponding location and performs a click action. Performance
was improved by increasing the pixel step size (ie. checking the color of every 15th
pixel instead of every pixel) and decreasing the search boundaries (only searching
within the flash game region and not the entire screen).

Note: The bot has only been tested with a screen resolution of 1440x900, the 
calibration code for other resolutions is still buggy. If you know the location of 
the flash game region for your screen size you can hard-code it in the 
ImageFind.setAnchors method.

INSTRUCTIONS:
=============
1. Go to game web site (link provided), make sure browser window is maximized
2. Click 'Calibrate' to calibrate the bot to your screen size
3. Click 'Start' to run the bot
4. Start the game

TO DO:
======
- Reduce number of misclicks (tweak search and click algorithm?)
- Fix calibration code for resolutions other than 1440x900
